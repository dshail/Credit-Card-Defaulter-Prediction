# Credit-Card-Defaulter-Prediction
### Project Short Summary

**Title:** Predicting Credit Card Default Payments in Taiwan

**Objective:** 
To accurately predict the probability of default among credit card holders in Taiwan using advanced machine learning techniques.

**Problem Statement:**
Credit card defaults pose significant risks to financial institutions. Predicting defaults accurately can improve risk management, resource allocation, and customer relationship management. The focus is on estimating the probability of default rather than simple binary classification.

**Proposed Solution:**
Develop a predictive model utilizing techniques such as logistic regression and gradient boosting. Evaluate model performance using metrics like ROC AUC and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistic to ensure high predictive accuracy.

**Technology Used:**
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Results:**
The model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting default probabilities, with effective differentiation between defaulters and non-defaulters as shown by the K-S chart.

**Conclusion:**
The predictive model enhances risk management by providing accurate probability estimates. Continuous validation and model updates are essential for maintaining accuracy and adapting to changing conditions.

**Future Scope:**
- Integrate real-time data for dynamic modeling.
- Explore ensemble methods and deep learning.
- Expand features and analyze demographic segments.
- Ensure regulatory compliance and improve model interpretability.
